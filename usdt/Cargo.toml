# NOTE: The use of path and version dependencies is deliberate and load-bearing.
#
# When building from source, this will select the version in the workspace, by
# path. When publishing the specific version will be used. Combined with the
# exact version requirements, this prevents issues like oxidecomputer/usdt#69,
# where the public-facing `usdt` crate may pick up different versions of the
# internal implementation crates.

# This feature used to be functional, but is now a no-op because inline `asm` is available on all
# supported versions of Rust. It's kept around for BC reasons, but whenever there's a breaking
# change to the `usdt` crate, this feature should be removed.
#
# There's also a comment about this in lib.rs -- remove it when this feature is removed.
