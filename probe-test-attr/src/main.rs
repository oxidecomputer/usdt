/// By deriving the `serde::Serialize` trait, the `Arg` struct can be used as an argument to a
/// DTrace probe. DTrace provides the `json` function, which accepts a JSON-encoded string and a
/// (possibly-nested) key, and prints the corresponding value of the JSON object. For example, in
/// this case one could use the DTrace snippet:
///
/// ```bash
/// $ dtrace -n 'stop { printf("arg.x = %s", json(copyinstr(arg1), "ok.x")); }'
/// ```
///
/// to print the value of the `x` field.

/// Providers may be defined directly in Rust code using the `usdt::provider` attribute.
///
/// The attribute should be attached to a module, whose name becomes the provider name. The module
/// can contain `use` statements to import any required items. Probe are defined as `fn`s, whose
/// bodies must be empty. The types of the function are the types of the DTrace probe, assuming
/// they are supported.
///
/// Note that in most cases, writing the provider in Rust or a D script is equivalent. The main
/// difference is in the support of serializable types. This can't be conveniently expressed in D,
/// as data there is simply a string. So if you want to provide a probe with a more complex Rust
/// type as an argument, it must be defined using this macro.
